### DATE:                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 
### AIM: 
To write a logic program to design a circuit like half adder and half subtractor.
###  Algorithm:
1. Start the Program
2. Design a AND gate logic if both inputs are 1 then output is 1.
3. Design a OR gate logic if any one of input is 1 then output is 1.
4. Design a XOR gate logic if both inputs are different then output is 1.
5. Design a NOT gate logic if input is 0 then output is 1.
6. Design a half adder and half subtractor using the rules.
7. Test the logic.
8. Stop the program.

### Program:











### Output:



### Result:
Thus the truth table of circuit verified sucessfully.
